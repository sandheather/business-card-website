	<p>I’m a graphic design student at Algonquin College.
		I am 19 years old. I have two cats named Bob and Marley.
		They make a lot of work but give a lot of love.
		There are many things I’d like to do in my life but I’m held back by my age and standards my family goes by.
		Specifically I’d like to get tattoos and I’ve designed a few already.
		I’ve wanted to dye my hair for the longest time but I don’t know if ill ever get around to it.
		I keep telling myself just enjoy life and be patient. My passion is art and
		I hope to bring my own style to the designs I create for future clients. </p>
